    My hobby is reading interesting and knowledgeable books in my free time.
    Whenever I go to home from my school I like to read such books after completing my homework. Now I know very well that reading is very good habit, which can make me educated. This hobby can be developed by annyone, however, I got this naturally. Reading books keeps one always happy and busy. It is the good source of enjoyment, knowledge, inspiration and instruction. It makes us disciplined, loyal, punctual and most importantly a successful person in the life.
